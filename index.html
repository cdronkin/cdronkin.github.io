        Delicious in Dungeon (also known as "Dungeon Meshi / ダンジョン飯") is an ongoing series following Laios Touden, a human knight, and his party of adventurers exploring through a seemingly endless dungeon created by a mad sorcerer wherein as long as their body is not harmed too severely, they are functionally immortal. Originally, he ventured in with a larger group, but in a fight against the infamous Red Dragon, his party is nearly wiped out. Their powerful mage and Laios's sister, Falin Touden, sacrifices herself and uses one last spell to send the rest of the party to safety before being eaten by the fearsome dragon. Now in a race against time to save Falin before she is digested by the Red Dragon, Laios resolves to head right back into the dungeon--a move which causes most of his party to abandon him. Down on their luck and running low on funds, the remaining group must rely on the dungeon itself to sustain themselves, turning this rescue mission into the perfect opportunity for Laios to finally taste test the monsters he and his party have been fighting for years! Will they make it to Falin in time? Or will they perish along the way, unable to subsist off of dungeon food? Follow along and find out now in <i>Delicious in Dungeon!</i>
