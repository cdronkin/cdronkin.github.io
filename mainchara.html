            <img src="Laios_Touden_Transparent.webp" class="chara">
            Laios Touden is a tall-man, this world's equivalent of a normal human. He is the leader of the party, <a href=#falin>Falin's</a> brother, and a sword-wielding force to be reckoned with in combat. He is kind and friendly, though lacking social skills and often leading him to overstep boundaries and frustrate people or end up in negative situations without realizing. He has a deep fascination with monsters and uses the knowledge he's accrued from exploring and his monster manual to figure out how to defeat and consume the various monsters in the dungeon. He thinks quick on his feet but can easily be distracted, putting himself in mortal danger without much consideration for his own safety.

            <img src="Marcille_Transparent.webp" class="chara">
            Marcille Donato is an elf, a humanoid race with long, pointed ears, slender builds, and very long lifespans relative to tall-men. She is the party's main mage after <a href=#falin>Falin</a> is eaten by the dragon. She is a graduate of Magic School, being the best student in her class. She plays by the books and has immense proficiency in her magical abilities, but can be seen as stubborn and high-strung, using her knowledge as a crutch without entertaining the idea that there are better ways to do things--a point of contention between her and <a href=#senshi>Senshi</a>. She is initially repulsed by the idea of eating monsters, thinking it to be unsafe and unsettling. Still, she is deeply dedicated to the cause as she and <a href=#falin>Falin</a> have been best friends since Magic School. Though loyal to her friends, she can easily be annoyed with their antics, ultimately she cares a great deal about her fellow party members.

            <img src="Chilchuck_Transparent.webp" class="chara">
            Chilchuck Tims is a half-foot, a race of small, lightweight humanoids with large ears and short lifespans relative to tall-men. He is the party's guide, traps specialist, and locksmith, using his small frame to his advantage to skillfully disarm traps without triggering them. Using his exceptionally good hearing and with his knowledge of the dungeon's layout and its typical traps, he is able to detect danger before the rest of his group and guide them through the mazelike dungeon. He is practical and sharp, opting to take very few adventuring jobs and asking for payment in advance, which is part of the reason he persists with <a href=#laios>Laios's</a> group even after <a href=#falin>Falin</a> is eaten. He keeps his private life and work life separate, much to the curiosity of <a href=#marcille>Marcille</a>. Though he does not often express it, he cares a great deal about the safety of the party and believes he is solely responsible for making sure his group does not perish in non-combat, non-food-related scenarios.

            <h2>Senshi / センシ</h2>
            <img src="Senshi_Full_Body_29.webp" class="chara">
            Senshi is a dwarf, a race of humanoids that are short, stocky, and long lived compared to tall-men. He has been living exclusively in the dungeon and subsisting off of it for over a decade. He initially is not part of <a href=#laios>Laios's</a> party. but joins the group after being inspired by their desire to survive off the dungeon's food rather than come in with their own. He is very stubborn and reckless, investing all of his energy and resources into living in harmony with the dungeon and nothing else, causing him to be a bit of a hermit outside of trading and bartering. Though his race is known for their affinity for metallurgy and weaponsmithing, he has no interest in either and relies on a fairly week axe to get by. He strictly refuses to use magic and can often be careless when exploring, much to the behest of <a href=#marcille>Marcille</a> and <a href=#chilchuck>Chilchuck</a>. However stubborn he is, he is willing to admit when he is wrong and learns to respect the members of the party.

            <h2>Falin Touden / ファリン トーデン</h2>
            <img src="Falin_trans.webp" class="chara">
            Falin is a tall-man, this world's equivalent of a normal human. She is a mage focusing in reinforcement, recovery, and exorcism spells. Though also attending Magic School, she was not popular and nor good at following instructions. She isolated herself from the rest of her class to learn from the world around her rather than rely on magical texts. She has a very close relationship with <a href=#marcille>Marcille</a>, having been friends since childhood as they both attended the same Magic school. She is very similar to her brother, <a href=#laios>Laios</a>, in her affinity for biology (monsters included), kind nature, and recklessness in the pursuit of saving her dearest companions. Her self-sacrifice to the Red Dragon serves as the catalyst for this story.
